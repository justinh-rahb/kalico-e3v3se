    idex_modes: Bugfix for kinematic position calculation.
    
    idex_mode would swap the X and dual-carriage rail in some cases
    (homing), but not in others. As such, the position calculation was
    correct while homing, but incorrect for the second carriage during
    normal moves. This commit fixes homing to work without swapped rails,
    removes the swapping of rails while homing, and removes the ability to
    swap rails (as it is now no longer used). Fix has been tested in a
    Hybrid_CoreXY IDEX printer (Voron Double Dragon). Hybrid_CoreXZ has
    identical changes and is similar enough that I am confident it will work
    as intended. Changes to cartesion seem simple enough, but would benefit
    from someone running a couple of tests.
